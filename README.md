# Cisco CE Room Devices - Macros
Here you can find a selection of macros for CE Room Devices. Macros is a great new feature intruduced in CE9.2 that allows you to customise your Room Device. It is especially powerful in combination with the In-Room Control Extensions of the Cisco Touch 10 Control Panel.

Macros available:


| Macro        | Description           |
| :------------------------ |:-------------|
| AppleTV Control      | Add an Apple TV remote control to the touch 10. All communication is done directly via HDMI-CEC. No control system needed.      |
| Audio Call Dial Pad | Ereate an in-room control application that adds a dedicated audio call dial pad to the Touch 10 |
| Audio Safe Guard      | Enforce a maximum output volume on the device. Demostrates a simple macro using API statuses and commands     |
| Camera Control with wide angle view      | Your custom camera control page, including creating a wide angle view of two cameras and controlling both simultaneously.      |
| CodingExamples      | A collection of small snippets showing more common coding questions related to the macro language and XAPI usage.      |
| Conditional Autoanswer with Prompt      | Auto answer on incoming calls - but only for a select number of remote sites      |
| Customer Satisfaction | Want to add a survey at the end of a call? This macro does this for you |
| In-Room Control Debugger | A helpful litte extension that shows a message on-screen every time a custom button is pressed or page opened and closed on the touch 10 |
| Join Webex with Prompt for Pin before connect | Add a Join Webex meeting button to the touch panel. Prompts the user to enter meeting ID and host pin before actually dialling the webex bridge  |
| Language Selector      | By default the touch 10 does not have a way for the end user to select the interface language. This macro adds this feature. Great for those multi-language environments. |
| One Button to Dial      | Do you always dial into the same bridge number? Why not have a single speed dial button on the home screen to do this?   |
| Prompt for Pin | Automatically show a prompt for pin on the touch 10 when calling a webex bridge  |
| Room Kit Pro Video Compositing | With CE firmware you have more customisation options and flexibility than ever. |
| Room Kit Pro/SX80 GPIO | See how to get the device to perform some actions when triggering a change on the built in GPIO. Add an one-button-to-dial button on the wall. |
| Scheduler | Have the endpint device automatically perform actions, like placing a call, at a specified time and day. |
| Speed dials      | Always dialling the same few numbers from the meeting room. Maybe want to add calling 911 or the Pizza Place more prominent?     |
| Proximity control      | Having multiple video endpoints in the same room and they're fighting over with proximity control over your phone or laptop. This macro allows you to have one simple button to control proximity.     |

## Requirements
1. Cisco Room Device (MX, SX, DX and Room Kit series)
2. Firmware CE9.2.1 or newer. Some macro  using newer features require newer firmware. See the requiremens list specified within each macro
3. Admin user access to endpoint

## Getting Started
1. Read the document [Working with Macros and In-room Controls](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/ce92/sx-mx-dx-room-kit-customization-guide-ce92.pdf) for a comprehensive introduction of In-Room Controls, Macros as well as step-by-step instructions on how to build and upload your code.
2. Watch this video for a quick introduction of what In-Room Controls are: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dw9zvvitp8


## Additional Information
##### XAPI
Documentation for the XAPI can be found in the [Command References overview](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/collaboration-endpoints/telepresence-quick-set-series/products-command-reference-list.html).

## Disclaimer
This example is only a sample and is **NOT guaranteed to be bug free and production quality**.

The sample macros are meant to:
- Illustrate how to use the CE Macros.
- Serve as an example of the step by step process of building a macro using JavaScript and integration with the Codec XAPI
- Provided as a guide for a developer to see how to initialize a macro and set up handlers for user and dialog updates.

The sample macros are made available to Cisco partners and customers as a convenience to help minimize the cost of Cisco Finesse customizations. Cisco does not permit the use of this library in customer deployments that do not include Cisco Video Endpoint Hardware.

## Support Notice
[Support](http://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/support) for the macros is provided on a "best effort" basis via DevNet. Like any custom deployment, it is the responsibility of the partner and/or customer to ensure that the customization works correctly and this includes ensuring that the macro is properly integrated into 3rd party applications.

It is Cisco's intention to ensure macro compatibility across versions as much as possible and Cisco will make every effort to clearly document any differences in the XAPI across versions in the event that a backwards compatibility impacting change is made.
